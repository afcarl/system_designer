Some behaviors that should be implemented:

- homophily/sorting
- communication
- reputation
- promises/threats (conditional behaviors and assessing the likelihood of follow-through)
- temporal discounting
- requests (i.e. asking for someone to do something)
- planning
- simple learning (reinforcement or Bayesian)
- utility functions
- mortality (i.e. agent death)
